This study objective is to implement the DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) algorithm for detecting anomalies in battery datasets. This study also aims to identify and categorize types of anomalies such as voltage cut-off and SOC estimation errors based on deviations in voltage range and SOC prediction accuracy and to utilize the results of anomaly detection in estimating the battery's State of Health (SOH) by calculating the ratio of normal (non-anomalous) data to the total dataset.
